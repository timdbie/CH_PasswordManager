# Python Password Manager

For my first project of the year I have made a Password Manager in Python using Tkinter Framework. This project was made in 3 weeks.

Libraries Used:
- Tkinter
- SQLite3
- Hashlib
- Pyperclip

**THIS APPLICATION IS NOT MEANT FOR DAILY USE, PLEASE USE A KNOWN PASSWORD MANAGER INSTEAD**
